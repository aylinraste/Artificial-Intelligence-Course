# Artificial Intelligence Course Projects and Homework

This repository contains the homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course, based on *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (3rd Edition, 2009). Most of the lecture slides are adopted from CSE-573 (Washington University), the original slides for the textbook, and CS-188 (UC Berkeley). The course combines foundational concepts with hands-on implementation tasks to provide a deep understanding of artificial intelligence.

## Homework Assignments

### HW1: Introduction, Search, and Optimization  
Focuses on foundational concepts such as search and optimization techniques. Practical tasks include implementing A-Star and Simulated Annealing algorithms.

### HW2: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Adversarial Search  
Explores solving arithmetic questions using CSP algorithms. Students also study adversarial search techniques.

### HW3: Markov Processes and Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
Introduces Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Practical work involves implementing Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for a cliff-walking environment.

### HW4: Bayesian Networks  
Covers the basics of Bayesian networks, with a practical implementation of a simple Bayes-Net.

### HW5: Machine Learning, Regression, and Decision Trees  
Focuses on machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, with hands-on implementation of these methods.
